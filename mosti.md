Ajout√©e le 15 oct. 2013
Commissioned by MTE Studios, an exhibition maker based in Dubai, Formula D interactive and partners developed 21 digital interactive media installations for a science and technology museum in Saudi Arabia. The interactive AV productions display various aspects of the technical and scientific advances of the Muslim world from 700BC to 1700BC in the fields of maths, medicine, botany, chemistry, astronomy, art and architecture besides others. The interactive AV's produced in the course of the project include touch tables, touch screens and other cutting edge interactive installations. During the 6 month design and production time, the design team worked closely with the client and researchers to conceptualize each application making sure the design of each interactive exhibit supported the exceptional visitor experience of the museum.
